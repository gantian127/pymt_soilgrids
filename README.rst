pymt_soilgrids is a package that converts `soilgrids package <https://github.com/gantian127/soilgrids>`_ into a reusable,
plug-and-play data component for `PyMT <https://pymt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_ modeling framework.
This allows the soil datasets to be easily coupled with other datasets or models that expose
a `Basic Model Interface <https://bmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
